> 1. What numbers in base 10 can be represented in 1 bit? In 2 bits?

1bit can represent $10^1$ numbers, i.e. 0~9.

2bit can represent $10^2$ numbers, i.e. 0~99.


> 2. What is the range of values of a BW pixel (or an element in a RGB pixel)?

$0 \text{ to } 2^8-1,$ if the bit depth is 8bit.


> 3. How can we rescale LSB values to take advantage of a pixel's range?

Assuming a 3bit LSB, multiply the pixel value by $\frac{255}{2^3 - 1}.$
