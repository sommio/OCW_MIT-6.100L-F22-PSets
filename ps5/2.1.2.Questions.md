If a number is divisible by 2, then its LSB is 0.

If n%2 is equal to 0, then its LSB is 0, otherwise it is 1.


> 3. Would the binary number xxx00 (x can be either 0 or 1) be divisible by 4? If so why?

No, unless one of the x's is 1.

If one of the x's is 1, it is always a multiple of 4.


> 4. What would be the remainder of these binary numbers when divided by 4: xxx01, xxx10, xxx11

Since the last two bits are n\*2^0 and n\*2^1, they are: 1, 2, and 3, respectively.


> 5. How can we extract the two LSBs of a base 10 number without converting it to binary?

$\text{lsb}_2 = n\mod 2^2$


> 6. How can we extract the n LSBs of a base 10 number without converting it to binary?

$\text{lsb}_p = n\mod 2^p$
